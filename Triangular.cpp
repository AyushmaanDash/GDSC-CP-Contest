// Bob is going to watch a movie with his friends. In the theater, there are seats numbered from 1 to 10^6. Out of those, Bob's friend has booked the seats numbered from l to r(inclusive).

// Bob only likes to sit on seats whose seat number is an triangular number:-

// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number

// You need to determine the number of seats that bob can sit on.

// Input Format

// The first line of input contains t - the number of testcases.

// Each test case contains two integers l and r.

// Constraints

// 1 <= t <= 2 * 10 ^ 5

// 1 <= l <= r <= 10^6

// Output Format

// For each test case, print one integer â€” the number of seats Bob can sit on.

// Sample Input 0

// 1
// 1 10
// Sample Output 0

// 4
// Explanation 0

// In between 1 and 10(inclusive), there are 4 triangular number: 1, 3, 6, 10
